# How i build


In this Project  I have made a Data Pipline to Transfrom our dataset.
Then upload it to Big Query for Analytics. 
I uploaded data file on stoarge bucket and then transformed data  using python .
For data pipline i have used Mage AI a tool for building data pipline .
I have installed it on VM instance and did all the tarnsformation and loading to big query from Mage AI.
I uploaded this transformed data on big query .
Then I connected it to Looker studio for bulding Dashboard and Finally used this data to Make a Dashboard from data.
